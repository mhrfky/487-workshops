# How to use
* Every action is given by notifications on the main page. Such as if you have discovered a new user, it just prints on the main page.
* To send a message you can choose the given section given on the command menu and then enter the ip you want to send a message. 
* If you just want to view the chat with the certain person, you can just enter the show chats section.
